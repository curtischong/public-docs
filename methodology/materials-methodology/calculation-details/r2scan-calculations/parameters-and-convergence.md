# Parameters and Convergence

## Calculation Parameters

We use the projector-augmented wave (PAW) or modeling core electrons with an energy cutoff of 680 eV. K-point grids were generated automatically by VASP using KSPACING values ranging from 0.22/Å to 0.44/Å. Specifically, the Monkhorst-Pack method is used for grid generation (with $$\Gamma$$-centered for hexagonal cells), and the tetrahedron method is used to perform the k-point integrations. These were determined from the GGA-estimated bandgap of each material based on the work by Wisesa et al. [\[1\]](parameters-and-convergence.md#references). More details regarding the calculation method can be found in ref [\[2\]](parameters-and-convergence.md#references); however, the Materials Project has updated many parameters as documented throughout the Methodology sections. The most up-to-date input sets can be [found here](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/blob/f9d9fe8e0ce09ef30cc03bcc4e9937d27afd5a6a/src/pymatgen/io/vasp/sets.py#L1315).

### Convergence

Plane-wave energy cutoff and k-point density settings were selected such that formation energies converged within approximately 1 meV/atom for a benchmark set of 21 materials and were selected to be conservatively high [\[2\]](parameters-and-convergence.md#references):&#x20;
